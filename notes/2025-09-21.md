I want someday to get to the level of engineering that will allow me to practically become him - Tony Stark. I'll be building, planning, exploring new ideas and in the end have something practical I'm proud of. All my ideas are too ambitious for my current level but projects of lower scale just don't interest me at all. I might need to become very intentional about the things I do, learn and spend time on. But it won't stop me from building my own arc reactor in not-so-cave from not-so-box-scraps B)
