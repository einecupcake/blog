I see those people on the internet. Those who built magnificent structures; those who redstone computers and automate everything; those who have all the diamonds in the world; those who have all the fame. I want it too. What do they have that I don’t? I can’t commit to one world long enough to have all that myself and all that is left is just watching them commit. Watching them build. Watching them develop. Watching them getting the resources and the fame. I see those people on the internet. I hate to watch them. But I hate even more that I don’t give myself the chance to grow like they do
