# Blank page

I have this fear of blank pages. When you see nothing and don't know where to start. It is not only about writing. I could say that we meet it in our daily life as well: when we turn the calendar, when we start reading new book, when we look at long to-do list in the morning. The fear of start. The fear of having to decide. Why do we run from making decisions? Isn't that our greatest achievement? The right to decide? To choose? To be wrong? To be right? To learn and to grow? How come that we are afraid of our own development? And yet here I am... writing about it... on a blank page.
