No one is perfect - but I will try to be.
I think that is the mindset that I should have. At least in part. Yes, I already wrote about my struggle with perfectionism and how I hate it, but maybe while being a *perfectionist*, I am not determined to *be* perfect. While wanting to get a perfect result, I am not trying to do it perfectly. I am procrastinating, lazy, I get bored too fast and never become the kind of person who could actually reach perfection. Great things are done by great men? Well I am not great then how do I achieve the "greatness"?

We will see in a week how and if I changed something in my life.
