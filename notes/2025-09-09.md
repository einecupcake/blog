# My struggle with Nvim

Neovim is basically Vim’s offspring: a text editor that refuses to behave like any text editor you’ve ever used.
I first heard of nvim from its famous ambassador ✨ThePrimeagen✨ but i never nearly imagined how deep is the rabbit hole. I literally started hating myself after using it for writing a simple C++ script and again and again failing to use hjkl instead of arrows. Nvim and his older brother Vim are in the no-mouse-cursor and for all of the actions you use the keyboard. I dont know if I will continue learning and using nvim motions and go into “customization” rage. At best, I’ll gain some muscle memory. At worst, I’ll still be googling “how to quit Vim” when I’m 30.
