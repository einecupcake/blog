# Potential

I am in this age of open doors and opportunities in every direction. For me, it's hard to decide on a "final" choice. I have this fear of wasted potential because deep inside I'm sure that whatever path I'll choose and stick to I will succeed anyway. Some Main Character energy, excuse me. But also I am very lazy. I know that I need to prepare (for whatever), but I'm just... confident that I'll do fine even without the preparation. Sometimes I wish that I was so insecure that I would prepare to death. But no. I choose the procrastination instead of success.
