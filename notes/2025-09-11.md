# In pursuit of extraordinary life

I am certainly chasing my own ideal but just as to a horizon Im never coming closer. Isn't this what people call “The rat race”? When we all, living in a capitalistic world, are trying to get to the top, to be the best, to earn more? Even if we deny it, society still carries us and as we could not stay still in the ocean - we could not stay still in our society. Its funny how I in my pursuit of the extraordinary is writing about how we all are trying to achieve it while being absolutely mediocre, and while thinking those thoughts and writing those lines I'm being extremely average. If by being "different" and thinking "out of the box" I am already being boring and non-creative: what is then the extraordinary life?
