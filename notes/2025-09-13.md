Procrastination is a modern person's worst enemy. Why do we do it even when we're fully aware? I caught myself thinking: "I know that I'll regret this decision and I have more important things to do". Like, huh!? What do you mean you know? I know that you know and that is the problem. </br> </br> Sometimes I think me and me are just two different people, two different minds in one body, and somehow the dumbest is the strongest that loves straightforward things and pleasure. The one that is putting now over tomorrow.</br> </br>I hate the constant loop of thinking about what I should have done instead of that and then. I literally can spend a few hours of constant doomscrolling and then turn on turbo productivity mode and do everything without the phone, social media and be happy about progress done. Am I this adrenaline junkie that cannot live without having stress in his life?
