# Learning to play guitar

I am setting up a goal for myself. I am determined to play at least one of my favorite songs on an acoustic guitar by the end of this month. I am into the rock genre and acoustic guitar was not really made for it, but I still have room to stretch. I could play Metallica, for example "Nothing Else Matters".

I will record a video and publish it on my instagram for everyone to see if I failed or succeeded in this challenge. My dear friends that are reading it right now are free to mock me if I will not publish anything within a month.
