# I don't feel like writing

I don't feel like writing. I don't have many themes I want to write or even ones that I do can write about. I shall take a break and again rethink and rearrange some of the aspects of my routine. After a month of school I feel like I no longer have the energy anymore to float, so before drowning completely I will try to change some things in my life. 

Maybe I will keep this blog updated. Maybe I won't.
