            <p>I have this fear of blank pages. When you see nothing and don't know where to start. It is not only about writing. I could say that we meet it in our daily life as well: when we turn the calendar, when we start reading new book, when we look at long to-do list in the morning. The fear of start. The fear of having to decide. Why do we run from making decisions? Isn't that our greatest achievement? The right to decide? To choose? To be wrong? To be right? To learn and to grow? How come that we are afraid of our own development? And yet here I am... writing about it... on a blank page.</p>

            <h3>We have Tony Stark at home!</h3>

            <p>I want someday to get to the level of engineering that will allow me to practically become him - Tony Stark. I'll be building, planning, exploring new ideas and in the end have something practical I'm proud of. All my ideas are too ambitious for my current level but projects of lower scale just don't interest me at all. I might need to become very intentional about the things I do, learn and spend time on. But it won't stop me from building my own arc reactor in not-so-cave from not-so-box-scraps B)</p>

            <h3>Potential</h3>

            <p><strong>Tags:</strong> #reflection</p>
            <p>I am in this age of open doors and opportunities in every direction. For me, it's hard to decide on a "final" choice. I have this fear of wasted potential because deep inside I'm sure that whatever path I'll choose and stick to I will succeed anyway. Some Main Character energy, excuse me. But also I am very lazy. I know that I need to prepare (for whatever), but I'm just... confident that I'll do fine even without the preparation. Sometimes I wish that I was so insecure that I would prepare to death. But no. I choose the procrastination instead of success.</p>

            <p>I like it after the sunset and before the sunrise. This is the only time when I am truly alone. In complete silence. When people are slowing down, getting ready to bed, and overall the darker half of the Earth is cooling down. When you try to be as silent as possible so as not to disturb. tick. tock. tick. tock. As if I get some kind of inspiration that you aren’t able to get during the day. When your mind is tired but still functions, and the natural flow of thought is filling the notes, the blank canvas, the empty assignment. I like it after the sunset and before the sunrise.</p>

            <p><strong>Tags:</strong> #random</p>
            <p>I see how again, I have been caught in the net of perfectionism and high standards. My previous entries are more and more… philosophical. as if, I’m writing about "important" stuff but sometimes there are no important things to write about. Life is just a routine and goes on and on and on…</p>

            <h3>My struggle with procrastination</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-09-13</p>
            <p><strong>Tags:</strong> #struggle</p>
            <p>Procrastination is a modern person's worst enemy. Why do we do it even when we're fully aware? I caught myself thinking: "I know that I'll regret this decision and I have more important things to do". Like, huh!? What do you mean you know? I know that you know and that is the problem. </br> </br> Sometimes I think me and me are just two different people, two different minds in one body, and somehow the dumbest is the strongest that loves straightforward things and pleasure. The one that is putting now over tomorrow.</br> </br>I hate the constant loop of thinking about what I should have done instead of that and then. I literally can spend a few hours of constant doomscrolling and then turn on turbo productivity mode and do everything without the phone, social media and be happy about progress done. Am I this adrenaline junkie that cannot live without having stress in his life?</p>

            <h3>In pursuit of extraordinary life</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-09-11</p>
            <p><strong>Tags:</strong> #life</p>
            <p>I am certainly chasing my own ideal but just as to a horizon Im never coming closer. Isn't this what people call “The rat race”? When we all, living in a capitalistic world, are trying to get to the top, to be the best, to earn more? Even if we deny it, society still carries us and as we could not stay still in the ocean - we could not stay still in our society. Its funny how I in my pursuit of the extraordinary is writing about how we all are trying to achieve it while being absolutely mediocre, and while thinking those thoughts and writing those lines I'm being extremely average. If by being "different" and thinking "out of the box" I am already being boring and non-creative: what is then the extraordinary life?</p>

            <h3>My struggle with Nvim</h3>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-09-09</p>
            <p><strong>Tags:</strong> #struggle</p>
            <p>Neovim is basically Vim’s offspring: a text editor that refuses to behave like any text editor you’ve ever used. I first heard of nvim from its famous ambassador ✨ThePrimeagen✨ but i never nearly imagined how deep is the rabbit hole. I literally started hating myself after using it for writing a simple C++ script and again and again failing to use hjkl instead of arrows. Nvim and his older brother Vim are in the no-mouse-cursor and for all of the actions you use the keyboard. I dont know if I will continue learning and using nvim motions and go into “customization” rage. At best, I’ll gain some muscle memory. At worst, I’ll still be googling “how to quit Vim” when I’m 30.</p>

            <p>einecupcake is planned to be my sandbox for all programming of mine. I've caught myself procrastinating programming because in the end I would be made to commit and publish everything. I don't want to procrastinate. Until I get comfortable with myself and my main github I will put my work somewhere here.</p>
